Continuing from [[2023-05-03]].

Another great morning! How lucky are we? In any case, let's get crackin' on some of this stuff.

Okay, so one thing that I've already encountered in a short playtest is that even when you JUMP onto one of the elevator platforms going upwards from a high height, you may encounter the Y-velocity bug with the Rigidbody. This begs... a few questions.

First of all, do I *need* the Rigidbody's velocity to be any non-zero value at all? I ONLY move the Rigidbody with MovePosition.

This brings up an interesting thing upon some research. From this one website, I read the line that if you want Kinematic Rigidbodies to work with other things, move them ONLY in FixedUpdate. And, I'm not currently doing that. So maybe I should, lol! I'll try that and see.

Long story short here, I've been thinking about making my Rigidbody kinematic if I can, because I'm actually lassoing it to obey my will so hard already, I might as well just make it so.

Anyways, I'm going to make a CharacterState OnFixedUpdate() method that I can break up into sub-Updates like I have the normal OnUpdate() function, but only with the code I need in there. Let's see how it goes, and if this is too yucky or unoconventional to try or not.

And before I go all gung-ho I want to at least aim for what I'm trying to fix. Some of these physics bugs like falling through the floor when falling too fast, this bouncy elevator busines, and more, *could* very well result from me moving my physics object outside of FixedUpdate. If I fix this here and it sovles these problems, I'm cleared to move on and test more down the line.

The key here is to move only what I need here. This is mostly going to be movement code, input and calculation things are OK to stay in normal Update (for now, as I see it).

In CharacterWalk, I know I can move my MovingPlatform code over to PreFixedUpdate() from PreUpdate(), but... What about the GroundCheck code? I'm going to move that over too, because that has to do with Physics. It might not be MOVING, but if that's how I'm checking things I'll try and keep it within that sort of 'timestep' or FixedUpdate() loop.
	Also a neat idea hit me... If my platform moving logic is insufficient in the future, I wonder about trying a coroutine waiting on FixedUpdate() to try and calculate, then map the position of the rider on the platform? It could be too expensive or just a weird approach, but it could  be cool!

Okay, the moving is done. Time to test!

Definitely seems like there is some improvements, I haven't fallen through the floor yet. Despite that, that pesky upwards elevator velocity bug still persists! How odd. And a kinematic rigidbody needs to handle its collisions and things through code, which I *could* do... but, that'd be an involved approach. It would be far from impossible, mostly just relying on my GroundCheck functions and the proper response, but yeah.

Okay, so I just fixed some code that definitely helped this. I KNOW for sure the FixedUpdate() fixes helped this, but also adding some code that helps the Player step with the Platform *in its proper direction* is working! Yay!
The upwards elevator interaction seems to have been resolved THUS FAR, but the downwards elevator is still there.

For now, I'll move on.

So I noticed something else, I can interrupt the longer TogglePlatform's movement patterns and break them, which reintroduces the upwards elevator bounce bug because the player isn't clinging to it and zeroing out its velocity. This is an easy fix, but not before I commit my changes.

Yep, one if statement barring toggling if we're currently moving, and that's done. NOICE!
