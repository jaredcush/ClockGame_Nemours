Good morning! Gosh, what a nice day. I'm so glad things are as they are. In any case, time to keep working for now.

Yesterday, I started on the Ability system, but I still wasn't very clear on exactly how I wanted to implement it. After working with the Corgi Engine, there were plenty of things I liked about their approach, especially integrating abilities with a CharacterController, so I'm trying to imitate that somewhat in my own way. In doing so, I need to figure out exactly how I'll handle my abilities.

(And before I forget, I have to implement some collision handling to influence the velocity, like hitting your head on a platform above you, and bumping into a wall. Currently, neither of which influence your velocity so as soon as you slip past, it's as if you never hit them.)

In short, here's what I want from my Abilities:
- To have a discernable animation to them
- To have their own rules for when abilities can be used
	- The Corgi Engine did this with a blocked states enum that appeared in the inspector as a neat little checklist. I liked this!
- To return control to the appropriate character state when finished (if they even *need* to switch states)

I have this idea in my head where I make a custom state that's one-size-fits all, but I'm not sure how well that'll work. I think I need to do it as I have it in my AwfulCatMetroidvania game; a custom character state that interacts with the AbilityManager.
	One other gripe that I"ve been encountering as well is how I share the data from my context class to my subclass. I've not put enough thought into how I encapsulate my data so people can't quite mess with it YET. There's public information in my context class that could be messed with (which could serve me with certain mechanics, I imagine) and that makes me worry. That said, there's no immediate issues with it but I'm concerned about it. Enough said for now.

I'm now going to try and implement an Ability-specific CharacterState and AbilityScript for the Pendulum. With this approach, I can really fine-tune how I want the abilities to behave. For example, I have this idea where you freeze in the air as you use the pendulum which allows time for the world to update, allowing for more creative and unconventional platforming sections.

I'm excited and getting lots of ideas so for RIGHT NOW I'm just going to try and get the ability working first.
