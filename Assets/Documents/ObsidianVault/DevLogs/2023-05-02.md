Right, so today starts the beginning of this Obsidian Library. I'd gotten some previous work done on my laptop, but I plan to refine and redo some of the things here to make some changes.

First things first today, I want to focus on making a basic CharacterController. I want to make the game *2.5D*, because I can use and produce some neat 3D Models for it, I just think it might look nice. That all said, let's get programming on my 2.5D CharacterController.

Right, so for my CharacterController, I want to make it a simple FSM so I can make more complex movement later if necessary. I'll pool the variables in the context script and do it like I've always done. This is my goal for tonight.

In developing this, I'm making a neat little double-raycast setup for ground-checking, because I liked the way the Corgi engine did it. That way, I can add a neat little animation when close to the edge of a platform or something.

In *double* raycasting, I thought it was interesting that you might be standing on two different colliders, and that's OK. Then I was thinking about more specific interactions I might want to check for, like specific buttons, platforms, and things like that but I'll worry more about those as they come.

Also, I'm using the new Input System because I like it :). I'm think it would be cool to have my state classes be able to subscribe and unsubscribe in their OnEnter & OnExit functions to the events that they need so it's sort of "self-service". I only fear making my InputActions public, even though it might serve me well if I want to make fun enemies or something that read your actions and act based on you. But that's for later.
On second thought I think I'll just use my usual approach of handler functions with the callback contexts.

Also for later, when I get to abilities and all that, I need to think about how I want to switch them (and what inputs I'd use accordingly, but that's again for later).

After a neat little bit of experimentation getting a decent-feeling horizontal movement state going, I've decided to work on my Air state. I have a  Jumping and Falling boolean to help with these. Long story short, we'll only switch back to our Walk state if we're *not* jumping and *are* falling (and if we're grounded, of course).
