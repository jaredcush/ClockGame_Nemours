Continuing from [[2023-05-08]].

So yesterday I worked some on starting the Wren's nest project. But I think Scott was right in suggesting a CENTRAL location for these projects rather than having them so decoupled...  At least in terms of convenience. Then again though, I would prefer the separation so I can treat them like two different projects, as they are, and so I can organize my efforts with them more efficiently.

Today, I want to make the little ability selector UI, the clock one. That'll be my little goal for today, as well as likely some more physics debugging and things like that. You can crush the player in the walls and stuff with the freely-steerable platform, and I'd like to avoid that, lol.

That said, there's plenty more to make, but I want to start with this UI. To do so, I'll pick up where I left off.
First things first, I want to allow or disallow abilities. Because it'll affect the AbilityManager, it'll affect the UI. To do this, I'll do it the Corgi way with having an enum for the types of the abilities supported and all that.
