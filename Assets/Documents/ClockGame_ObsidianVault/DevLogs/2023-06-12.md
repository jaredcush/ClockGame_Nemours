Continuing from [[2023-05-23]]. Man, it's been a second since I was able to commit to pushing HARD changes to the game. This next commit might have some miscellaneous information and smaller updates that I didn't update prior. Hehe, but hmm...

In any case, I start teaching again tonight, which I'm excited about! Only that it's in a few hours so I'll try and keep some of my work small on this project for today. Tomorrow I'm going to Nemours, rain or shine, because I *finally can* so I'm excited as well.

In any case, I want to see if I can't try to make some stylized wooden pixel things for UI. I'll do a little something for the AbilityClock UI. But I have noted what I need to do physics-wise to keep progressing and all that.

So I just made a little clock sprite for the AbilityClockUI like I described, and it's not bad! Not terrible anyways.

Besides all that, I really want to lay out a bit of a roadmap on what I need to get done with this project in particular. As noted, the levels are going to be the bottleneck, but I've come up with a bunch of designs for level elements that I can attempt. At the same time, the game needs some better visuals, and more physics debugging. I'll return with some more planning after dinner and after I teach. I can't wait!
