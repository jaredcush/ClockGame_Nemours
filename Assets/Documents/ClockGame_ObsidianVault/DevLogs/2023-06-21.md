Continuing from [[2023-06-14]]. I've been COOKING lately (and frankly, somewhat cooked myself lol). That said, this week I have some delicious time to get some tasks done. I really am aiming to create some more delicious puzzle elements since I made the MatchBlocks, I feel like that was the right direction with some of these game elements.

Quickly, REJOICE for the SUMMER SOLSTICE!

Tonight, I'm specifically targeting making some doors or progress-blocking elements that open / respond only to an invoked event by another object. I'm speaking generically, because I *could* possibly reuse one of my platform scripts to do this... if the door is some sort of of tall thing that rises out of your way.
