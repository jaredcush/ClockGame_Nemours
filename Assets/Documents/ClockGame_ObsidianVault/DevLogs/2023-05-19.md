Continuing from [[2023-05-18]].

Ah, after a long day of work I'm finally back and ready to work. So here, I just need to do a few things in this project to reach my weekly goal for this project. Then I move onto the Wren's Nest.

What remains for this weekly goal:
- LevelEndUI
	- Write text for LevelClock
	- Hook up Buttons to SceneManager
- Level Design
	- Make a simple level

---

So first, I tackled writing the text for the LevelClock. Now let's get some functions for those buttons in the GameManager.
There's just a small issue with the GameManager across scenes, I need to make sure ONLY one exists at a time. Now that's mostly taken care of... Yippee!
One more thing too... if I load a scene with a GameManager that already exists, I need to delete it BUT ALSO set my LevelEndUI button functions to the PROPER GameManager.

I ALSO JUST remembered about `#region` and  `#endregion` and MAN I'm so glad I did. I might use that instead of my cutesy little `// + + + + | X | + + + + ` region delimiters and all that.

Grr, so I need to find SOME way to get consistent access to the current LevelManager. There's a very crucial time as the scenes switch that the CurrentLevelManager is null. In that time, scripts are trying to access it in OnDisable.

Alright, I've managed to figure it out some. A few fixes occurred here, mostly with guaranteeing that the LevelManager can be found properly, and that the UI is drawing itself properly. Woohoo!
