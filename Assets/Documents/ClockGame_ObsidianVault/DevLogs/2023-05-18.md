Woohoo, I can't wait to be back on the day I don't work all morning and afternoon! I'm so excited, I'm really glad that I was able to figure things out the way I was last entry.

So the two main things that are really left as per my goals for this week are to make a simple level for this game, and to make a basic level end sequence. For now, leaving things greyboxed and ugly is *ok*, and I have to be *ok* with that. I will NOT devote time to overly fancy things NOW, I'll just try and get some things done. Huzzah!

### Level End Sequence
So first on the list is trying to get a basic level end sequence, but ***NOT BEFORE MAKING A BRANCH FOR THIS WORK***.

Firstly, I'm going to turn off the existing Ability-related UI when the level ends. I'm thinking I want some functionality to handle turning off and on some UI. In fact, and not to be weird, maybe these UI things should persist between scenes... It would reduce some overhead and loading times, but... Maybe not, that seems weird. In any case, I'll make an interface to have some shared ActivatableUI.

Here's a little something, I want to unsubscribe from events in OnDisable, but a KEY time when OnDisable is called is when the game is ending. Now, when I try to access the LevelManager from the GameManager singleton after it's destroyed, it creates a NEWGameManager and messes things up. I'll have to see about having some way to tell if the Instance exists without getting it and making a new one...
So I solved this temporarily by adding an 'Exists' field for my Singleton. It returns true if the private instance of the Singleton isn't null, and that seems to work. That actually would have solved my OnValidate issues, I'm thinking.

So now that that works, let me see more about an 'activated' field for the UI. It should probably just prevent the UI from doing what it typically does, which sounds reductive but surprisingly isn't. The AbilityClockUI will not update, and the PendulumUI won't show. I can do this with any other UI I choose to make. Yippee!

So that works for now. I'll try for some shorter commits so I'm going to commit this. Afterwards, I found another error with my Checkpoints, I'm no longer storing the last known one.
