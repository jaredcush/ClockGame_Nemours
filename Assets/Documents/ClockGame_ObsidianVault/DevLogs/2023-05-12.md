Continuing from [[2023-05-11]].

I have a meeting with Scott soon, I just got back from work and had lunch. Ah, what a nice spring day it was. It was almost pretty hot!

That said, I have some more plans for today. In our meeting, I want to bring up:
- Progress
	- My progress with the Clock Game
		- Have most core systems ready apart from audio and scene management.
		- Implemented Day/Night cycle? Could be useful for Wren's Nest.
		- Can have a single level ready by next Monday.
	- Progress with Wren's Nest
		- Essentially just a CharacterController walking around the world at the moment, BUT it's started.
- Aesthetic
	- 2.5D with Sprites (I can mostly do the sprite work)
	- Full 3D with 3D models (I'd have trouble with modeling, but COULD animate if necessary)
- Planning & Discussion
	- 'Snow-Globing' for the Wren's Nest
	- Remarkable Theming Flexibility for the Clock Game

Planning:
- Get Clock Game level done by next Monday
- Mockup one "snowglobe" in the Wren's Nest
	- Complete selection mechanic
		- Pull up UI off selection, confirmation stuff
		- Link off to another resource

But after all of this, there's a quick little feature I want to make. I wanted to make some trigger for a level-ending sequence and all that. Just something to denote the end of a level and all that.
	Firstly, really quick, I'd fixed a bug so that our LevelManager ALWAYS tries to get checkpoints in Start() and all that for the current level. As well, for ease of use, the Checkpoints use OnValidate to name themselves properly and add themselves to the Checkpoints list.
	There's likely some redundancy and room for optimization with the calls made, but it works for now which is cool.

If I can "soft finish" a level by having some level end trigger and sequence planned out, we'll really be all good. 

### NEARLY Forgetting my ClockPieces
EVEN BEFORE THAT THOUGH, I totally forgot to go make the ClockPieces throughout the level and all that. Those, as per the GDD, were the main MacGuffins that let you progress through the level and all that. You can't leave the level without having ALL of them, so I'm thinking I can make little platforming challenges and things like that to lead you to them.

So I guess, let's make those and we'll be mostly set to start the end of a level!

Thinking about the UI necessary, I'd like to do something with the
