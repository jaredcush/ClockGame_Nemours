Continuing from [[2023-05-16]].
Man, I've been worked to the bone at my other job this week. BUT, next week I have ALL the weekdays off so I'm going to be LABBING in here. So excited!

That said, today I'm finally going to try and solve the problems that I identified solutions for in the previous note: making a GameManager to centralize some resources, and giving it a way to hook up to the LevelManager.

And done. Now THAT's a persistent singleton being used BETTER than my previous approach. It also helps I'm not doing a lot of silly business in OnValidate anymore.

I'll commit this work finally, and then proceed after I replace the battery in my fire alarm, lol. That squeaking is killing me!

Alright now, it's a little later after fixing all of that previously.

### ExitGates
Now, I'll want to start making the ExitGate. This HAS made me think though...
	In a previous entry, I was thinking that it might be inappropriate for the LevelManager to maintain some list of Found ClockPieces and all that. I felt that it might belong better on the Player. But at the same time, centralizing it there might be easier, because they're so *key* to the level.
	For now, I'll keep the maintained list of Found ClockPieces there.

In any case, time to make the more complex ExitGate, collision-wise.

So I'll have to think of how I do this... For one, I need the Player to collide with the ExitGate and then try some input to activate it. That said, I have to find some way to figure out that I'm both pressing a specific input AND touching a door. Let's see if I can't just poll the state via the inputaction...
I can do it either way thanks to the PlayerMovementVector Vector2 that's public. I suppose it would be more correct to check it from the Player so I can most accurately poll the state of the IA. This is my current approach in OnTriggerStay, but there might be a more slick way to do this. I think of taking the Vector2.up input as its own special input, and SphereCasting when it happens, fancy stuff like that... but that seems like overkill for now.

So now that that's BASICALLY working, I want to take a look at the Exit Sequence. I probably won't take care of this today since it's late already, but I can still do the planning.
