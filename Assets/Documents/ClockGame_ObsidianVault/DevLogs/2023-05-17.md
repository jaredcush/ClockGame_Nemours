Continuing from [[2023-05-16]].
Man, I've been worked to the bone at my other job this week. BUT, next week I have ALL the weekdays off so I'm going to be LABBING in here. So excited!

That said, today I'm finally going to try and solve the problems that I identified solutions for in the previous note: making a GameManager to centralize some resources, and giving it a way to hook up to the LevelManager.

And done. Now THAT's a persistent singleton being used BETTER than my previous approach. It also helps I'm not doing a lot of silly business in OnValidate anymore.

I'll commit this work finally, and then proceed after I replace the battery in my fire alarm, lol. That squeaking is killing me!
